    "## **Object**, **Class**, and **Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object**, **class**, and **instance** is super important in **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** â€” especially in languages like **C++, Python, Java**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "### âž¤ Think of it like a **blueprint** or **template**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It **defines** what an object will be like, but itâ€™s **not an actual thing** yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is like a **recipe** for making a cake.\n",
    "It says:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What ingredients (data) you need (like flour, sugar â€” these are variables/attributes)\n",
    "* What steps (methods/functions) to follow\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“˜ In code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    string brand;\n",
    "    void start() {\n",
    "        cout << \"Car started\";\n",
    "    }\n",

    "## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "### âž¤ An **object is the real thing** made using the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s the **actual cake** you bake using the recipe.\n",
    "You can create **many objects** from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If `Car` is a class, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "Car myCar;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `myCar` is an **object** â€” a **real, usable car** created from the Car class.\n",

    "## ðŸ”¹ 3. **Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "### âž¤ An **instance** is just another name for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"Object\"** refers to the **actual entity**.\n",
    "* **\"Instance\"** means \"**an occurrence** of that class in memory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> So every object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Example:\n",

    "```cpp\n",
    "Car myCar;  // Object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `myCar` is an **object**, and it is also an **instance of class Car**.\n",
