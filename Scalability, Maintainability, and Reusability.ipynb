    "> \"If your shop has 10 customers now and 1,000 later â€” can it still handle everyone without crashing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ›  In software:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can your app or system handle **more users, more data, more requests**?\n",
    "* Without slowing down or breaking?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Œ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your **diabetes prediction web app** works well for 100 users.\n",
    "If tomorrow 10,000 people use it â€” **will it still run smoothly?**\n",

    "\n",
    "You wrote a Python function to **convert speech to text** for ASTRA ROBO.\n",
