### 📝 **Transistor and Binary Value*

* A **transistor** is a **semiconductor device** that controls the **flow of electric current**.
* It works like a **switch**, with two states:

  * **ON (conducting) → represents 1**
  * **OFF (non-conducting) → represents 0**
* In **digital electronics**, each transistor can represent **one binary value (0 or 1)**.
* Transistors are the **basic building blocks** of computers, used in logic gates, memory, and processors.
* Modern systems use **billions of transistors** to store and process data in binary form.
