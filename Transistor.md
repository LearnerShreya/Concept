### 📝 **Transistor and Binary Value**

* A **transistor** is a **semiconductor device** that controls the **flow of electric current**.
* It works like a **switch**, with two states:

  * **ON (conducting) → represents 1**
  * **OFF (non-conducting) → represents 0**
* In **digital electronics**, each transistor can represent **one binary value (0 or 1)**.
* Transistors are the **basic building blocks** of computers, used in logic gates, memory, and processors.
* Modern systems use **billions of transistors** to store and process data in binary form.

### 📝 **Transistors & Binary Data**

* **1 transistor = 1 bit = stores 0 or 1**
* More transistors = More bits = More data combinations


### 🔢 **Examples:**

| Transistors | Bits | Combinations (2ⁿ)  |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| 1           | 1    | 2 (0, 1)           |
| 2           | 2    | 4 (00, 01, 10, 11) |
| 4           | 4    | 16 (0000 to 1111)  |
| 8           | 8    | 256                |

🧠 **Formula:**
**n bits → 2ⁿ combinations**

| Term         | Meaning                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Transistor   | Semiconductor switch         |
| ON State     | Current flows → Binary **1** |
| OFF State    | No current → Binary **0**    |
| 1 Transistor | Represents 1 bit (0 or 1)    |
